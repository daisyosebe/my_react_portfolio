      <p className='about'>
      My journey into coding began during my college years while I was studying Nursing . Intrigued by the potential of technology, I decided to explore the world of programming languages and software development. Starting with cs50 course, I quickly became engrossed in learning languages like Python and JavaScript. The more I delved into coding, the more fascinated I became by its versatility and power to create solutions. As I am developing simple web applications, Im finding joy in the process of problem-solving through code. With each new skill I acquired, I became increasingly passionate about leveraging technology to tackle pressing world issues.
